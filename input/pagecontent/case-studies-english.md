#### Best practice example: Control of Anticoagulation effect

Mrs Birgit Blum had an unfortunate fall while skiing and sustained a multifragmentary tibial plateau fracture. She was transferred to the Kantonsspital, a centre hospital, by helicopter and is waiting there for her operation. The patient is administered Liquemin 5000 E s.c. daily to prevent thromboembolic events, and the effect. A To monitor the effect of this treatment, regular blood tests are carried out to determine anti-Xa activity. A special sample vessel with citrate additive is used for this purpose. The sample must be centrifuged and cooled within one hour. An important entry from her list of problems is heart disease.

### CH LAB-Order 1-tvt

#### Suspicion of deep vein thrombosis

A patient, Tobias Timmermann, presents to Dr. med. Marc Mustermann at the Olten group practice on 09.03.2016. He verbally identifies himself via his master data as   Tobias Timmermann, 01.01.1984. He reports unclear leg pain in the left lower leg as well as simultaneously occurring respiratory pain and cough. The doctor carries out the anamnesis and physical examination and prescribes the following laboratory parameters:

* Blood cell count incl. differentiation
* CRP
* D-dimer

The doctor carries out the Blood count and the CRP determination himself by means of point of care diagnostics, the D-dimer diagnostics is prescribed as quantitative diagnostics in an external sending laboratory. To obtain the sample, a Blood sample is taken lying down (1 EDTA tube, 2 citrate tubes of 5 ml). The order is transmitted to the external laboratory and the sample is sent to the external dispatch laboratory by courier ordered by telephone. The results of the internal point of care diagnostics (Blood count and CRP) are entered in the patient\`s laboratory sheet in the doctor\`s office software (manually or via locally installed electronic interfaces). A prescription is therefore issued by the doctor to the patient for self-administration of an anti-thrombotic agent. The results of the sending-in laboratory arrive electronically at the GP\`s on the same evening and are also entered in the patient\`s laboratory sheet. By using the present exchange format, this process can be fully automated. After a telephone enquiry by the doctor at the sending laboratory due to a borderline D-dimer result, the information is given that a deep vein thrombosis cannot be ruled out in this situation by means of D-dimer and the patient is therefore called back the next day for a sonography of the legs.
As it is probably a primary leg vein thrombosis, Dr Eva Erlenmeier from the Pipette laboratory sends feedback to Dr Mustermann with the recommendation to carry out a thrombophilia screening, which includes the following analyses: Quick, aPTT, fibrinogen, antithrombin (funct.), thrombin time I 2.5 NIH/ml, APC resistance, D-dimers, protein C, (aPTT method), protein S antigen. The analyses can be carried out directly from the samples of the citrate tubes sent along.

### CH LAB-Order 2-pertussis

#### Suspicion of whooping cough

A mother visits the family doctor Peter Presto of the Olten group practice with her 6-year-old son Emil Kummer, born 5 May 2014, because the child has been coughing increasingly for a fortnight, with cramping cough attacks, and has a fever. The doctor\`s receptionist measures the fever, takes a fingertip Blood sample from the son, determines the CRP and prepares a Blood smear. The doctor suspects a viral infection, but wants to rule out whooping cough, although the child has been vaccinated against it. As he is under time pressure due to an emergency, he does not want to do the necessary throat swab himself, but asks the mother to accompany the child to the nearby laboratory to have the swab done in peace. He prepares a laboratory order to carry out a pertussis PCR on the child\`s throat swab and gives the order to the mother. The mother herself is not sure whether she herself has been vaccinated against pertussis. Consequently, the family doctor Peter Presto gives her the pertussis vaccination right away and recommends that the same be done for the child\`s father and grandparents. In the meantime, the MPA has looked at the son\`s Blood smear under the microscope and finds a lot of reactive lymphocytes, which seem suspicious to her. She is unsure and asks the doctor, who gives the order to give the child\`s Blood smears to the mother and also to have them examined more closely in the laboratory. The mother arrives at the laboratory with her son, where the doctor\`s order is first to establish the son\`s identity. Then a pharyngeal swab and a right cubital venepuncture are taken from the child in the laboratory\`s Blood collection room and passed on to the laboratory together with the Blood smears and the doctor\`s examination order.
